## Dragon Fight Tweaks üêâ <Badge type="tip" text="^0.6.0" />

### 1. Respawn Crystals

Destroyed end crystals will respawn after ~1.6 - 3 minutes. This makes the fight much harder and a bit more annoying.

### 2. Scale Health by Max Players

Scale the dragon's health based on the maximum number of players who have been to the end during the fight.

The formula is this: $(\sqrt{500 * x}) * 10$, where $x$ is the number of players.

### 3. Shorter Crystal Tracking Range

Reduce the range in which the dragon can heal itself with crystals from 32 blocks to 24 blocks.

### 4. Shorter Spikes

All newly generated spikes will be shorter.

## Throwable Items ü•è <Badge type="tip" text="^0.5.0" /> 
[![Requires Commander](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/constellation-mc/commander/documentation/docs/public/badges/requires/compacter_vector.svg)](https://modrinth.com/mod/cmd)

Throw certain items, which would otherwise be useless*

::: details Throwable items as of 0.5.0


* Bone Meal
* Glowing and Normal Ink Sacs
* All Dyes
* Nether and Normal Bricks
* Fire Charge
* Gun Powder

Ideas welcome! 

:::

There's an additional option available: Can Zombies Throw Items?

With this on, zombies will throw any throwable items they pick up.

::: details Adding Custom Behaviors

All behaviors must be placed in `andromeda/item_throw_behavior` of your datapack, along with `recipes`, `tags`, `loot_tables`, etc. The name of the file doesn't matter.

Since 1.10.0, Andromeda uses [Commander](https://modrinth.com/mod/cmd) for its data pack features. You can learn about commands, Arithmetica and more over at its wiki. https://constellation-mc.github.io/commander/

Example:

```json
{
  "items": "minecraft:ink_sac",
  "complement": true,
  "events": [
    {
      "event": "any",
      "commands": {
        "type": "andromeda:particles",
        "selector": "minecraft:direct_killer_entity",
        "colors": [24, 27, 50]
      }
    },
    {
      "event": "entity",
      "commands": {
        "type": "commander:commands",
        "selector": "minecraft:this_entity",
        "commands": [
          "/effect give @s minecraft:blindness $(long){{random(4, 7)}} 0 true"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`events` is a list of mini subscriptions to flying entity events.

| Event  |   |
|---|---|
| `block`  | Executed when the item hits a block.  |
| `entity`  | Executed when the item hits an entity.  |
| `miss`  | Executed when the item misses.  |
| `any`  | Executed after any of the previous events.  |

`commands` is a list of [Commander commands](https://constellation-mc.github.io/commander/Commands).

Other things:

| Parameter  |   |
|---|---|
| `override_vanilla`  | If true, prevents **ALL** vanilla behaviors from being executed. This should never be used on block items, as it will make the block unplaceable.  |
| `disabled`  | Disables all behaviors for this item.  |
| `complement`  | If false, disables all other behaviors.  |
| `cooldown`  | Set a custom cooldown for your item (in ticks). Accepts numbers and [Expressions](https://constellation-mc.github.io/commander/Expressions)  |

## Wandering Trader Horn üêê <Badge type="tip" text="^0.4" />

Every 2 days, you can blow the "sing" horn to summon a wandering trader.

Please note that wandering traders will still spawn naturally

You can disable the "doTraderSpawning" gamerule if you don't want them to.
