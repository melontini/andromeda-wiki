## Loot Barrels 💎 <Badge type="tip" text="^1.13.0" />

Add random barrels with loot to caves!

By default, barrels will contain same loot as a village toolsmith. You should be able to change the loot and decorations by overriding the feature using a data pack!

## Moist Control 💦 <Badge type="tip" text="^1.4.0" />

Control farmland hydration range. As simple as that!

## Self Planting Crops 🌾 <Badge type="tip" text="^0.6.0" />

If possible, plants will plant themselves after some time. Since 0.7.0 you can white/blacklist plants.

## Falling Bee Nests 🐝 <Badge type="tip" text="^0.1" />

Randomly, bee nests will fall from their trees, making the bees inside homeless & if a player is nearby, very angry.

In my tests, it usually takes 0-2 days for a nest to fall.

Arrows also work!

## Temperature Based Crop Growth Speed 🌡️ <Badge type="tip" text="^0.4" />

When this option is on, plants will only grow in their preferred temperatures, e.g. cacti will only grow in deserts, nether and savannas.

This option is data-driven! Checkout [this](https://github.com/melontini/andromeda/blob/1.20-fabric/src/main/resources/data/andromeda/andromeda/crop_temperatures/crops/minecraft_wheat.json) for an example and more info.

## Fast Fire Spread 🔥 <Badge type="danger" text="Deprecated" /> <Badge type="tip" text="^0.2.1" />

Fire will spread much faster and wider.
