## Infinite Totem of Undying ‚ôæÔ∏è‚ô•Ô∏è <Badge type="tip" text="^0.4.3" />

<br/>
<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/images/infinite-totem.webp" width="520">

<sub>Works the same way as normal totem, but infinitely...</sub>

To get one of these "totally not OP" totems, you need to have a level 4 beacon made from diamond and netherite blocks.

The beacon must follow this pattern: 

```
    B
   NNN
  DDDDD
 NNNNNNN
DDDDDDDDD
```

Where N is netherite and D is diamond.

Now throw a nether star and a totem onto the beacon and watch them ascend.

You can also disable ascension in the config and create your own way to get the totem!

## Balanced Mending ‚öíÔ∏è <Badge type="tip" text="^0.4" />

Makes mending a bit less OP by making it remove the "Too Expensive" error instead of repairing items via XP.

Also sets anvil's XP cap to 40 levels, but not really because the cap is 40 + the amount of repair items.

Inspired by TheMisterEpic's "This Minecraft Enchantment has been BROKEN for 3 YEARS..." video

## Minecart Block Picking ü•í <Badge type="tip" text="^0.1" />

Allows you to "pick up" blocks using minecarts. All contents and some properties are copied to the cart.

For the sake of balance, you can configure whether players can "pick up" spawners.
